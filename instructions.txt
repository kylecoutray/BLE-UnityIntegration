Steps to use:

1) run the nanoBLE arduino script
	- this sets up each arduino nano for broadcasting.
	- this will be used in the next script. 
	- make sure to CHANGE NAME in line 24 for left/right
	
2) run the bleakScanner.py
	- search for rightNanoSense and leftNanoSense
	- make note of their device ID

3) run doubleNanoBLEread.py
	- this code will read the update from each then
 	write it to a file named: currentSpeedLeft.txt 
	and currentSpeedRight.txt respectively.
	- IMPORTANT: make sure all the info is input correctly:
		- left/right nano address
		- UUID (should be correct if you used the nanoBLE script))
		- FILE_PATH (left and right) for currentSpeed texts

4) run the Unity Script
