# BLE-UnityIntegration

This project uses BLE devices to control a Unity camera in real time. The system evolved through three phases:

Phase I: Garmin Speed Sensor

Phase II: Single Arduino Nano BLE

Phase III: Dual Arduino Nanos for differential steering and speed

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



**Phase 1:**
  This project is to connect to a Garmin Speed Sensor 2 through BLE and parse the real time speed from the CSC data stream to manipulate a Unity environment.
  
  I am utilizing the bleak and asyncio library. 
  
  You must do `pip install bleak` for the following scripts to run.
  
  1) run `bleakScanner.py` to look for device (to find bluetooth address)
  2) run `gattServices.py` to see the services available to subscribe to
  3) run `batteryLevel.py` to see battery level (not verified if this is accurate)
  4) run `speedNotification.py` to get live updates of the speed (estimated in m/s)
  
  **To run the Unity Scene properly:**
  1) Fix all file paths on local machine
  2) Turn on Speed Sensor 2 (Rotate until lights flash)
  3) Run `speedNotification.py`
  4) Enter ` "y" ` when prompted
  5) Run Unity simpleBLE "barebones" scene
  
  Control camera with arrow keys, camera will accelerate based on speed sensor.
  
  Let me know if you have any issues or questions :)

## üî¥ Phase III: Dual Arduino Nano BLE ‚Äì Differential Control

Phase III introduces **two Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense boards**, simulating left and right wheel speeds for advanced motion control.

### Logic Enhancements

* **Angle** = Difference between left/right speeds
* **Forward Speed** = Average of both speeds
* **Sliding Factor** = Controls how sharply angle changes

## üìú How to Use (Phase III)

### 1. **Run Arduino Sketch**

* Upload `nanoBLE.ino` to each Nano
* **Important**: Edit line 24 to label each device as `"leftNanoSense"` or `"rightNanoSense"`

### 2. **Find BLE Addresses**

* Run `bleakScanner.py`
* Locate both `leftNanoSense` and `rightNanoSense`
* Save their addresses

### 3. **Start Dual BLE Read**

* Run `doubleNanoBLEread.py`
* This script:

  * Connects to both Nanos
  * Writes speed data to `currentSpeedLeft.txt` and `currentSpeedRight.txt`
* **Check config**:

  * Correct BLE addresses
  * Valid characteristic UUID
  * Valid file paths for output

### 4. **Launch Unity Scene**

* Unity reads from the speed files to simulate motion
* Steering and speed are determined live
